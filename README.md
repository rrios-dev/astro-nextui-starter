## Overview

Seeds is an advanced hash generation web application developed with the robust Astro framework using TypeScript. This state-of-the-art tool offers custom hash generation based on a seed phrase with a plethora of customizable parameters including token length, the number of hash groups (modules), and the number of hashes per module. Designed for efficiency and ease of use, Seeds caters to a variety of use cases from security to software development.
